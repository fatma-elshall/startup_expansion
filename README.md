**Insights and storytelling :

* we have 149 city in 35 states

* there was 140 old store and 10 new stores

* total profit in old stores(140 stores) was 5032233 which means that each store has a net profit 35944

* total profit in new stores ( 10 stores) was 429010 which mweans that each store has a net profit 42902

this means that the new stores earned more profit (about 7000) than the old.

* "San Mateo" city was the lowest in marketing spend.

* the highest profit was in Little Rock city in Arkansas state and it was 66388.

* the lowest profit was in Everett city in Washington state and it was 12433.

* the highest marketing spend was( 3984)in Amarillo city in Texas state ,although it doesn’t made the highest profit which means that the high spend doesn’t equal the high profit.

 
* at new stores , california state takes the first place , followed by a new state(Illinois) and texas state.


  **Recommendation**

* the expansion in new stores with the same possibilities as the new one or development will be better than the expansion in old .
